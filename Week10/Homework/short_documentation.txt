Short documentation for the Dijkstra algorithm.

The code utilizes the networkx package to manipulate create and work with graphs, namely the Barab√°si-Albert graph. The main function of the code is the Dijkstra_algorithm function which takes a graph, a source and the number of nodes in the graph and calculates the distance of each node from the source 
in the graph. Then the procedure is repeated for each different sources and the distances are averaged for the different source degrees. To overcome statistical
fluctuations we generate many different graphs and find the averages over them.
