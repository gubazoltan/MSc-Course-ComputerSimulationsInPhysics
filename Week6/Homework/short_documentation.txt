This is a short documentation for the numerov.py code. 

The code uses the so called Numerov method to solve the Schr√∂dinger equation for different types of potentials. 
Currently there are two types of potentials implemented, a square potential and a gaussian potential. Both of these can be scaled to be a potential hill 
or a potential well.
These potentials can be addressed with numerov.square_potential() and with numerov.gaussian_potential(). 

The main function of the code is numerov.scattering which calculates the wavefunction of a particle scattering off from a potential
with energy E. The function takes as arguments the energy of the particle, the type of potential, the height of the potential, the width of the potential
and the number of position values evaluted inside the potential.
This function returns the reflectance and the transmission coefficients for the scattering. 

One can also obtain the analytical solutions for the square potential with the use of the numerov.analytical_curve() which returns the analytical value
of the transmission coefficient. 

The transmission coefficients as a function of energy can be easily obtained out via the numerov.multi_scattering_energies() function which
takes as its argument (besides the usual arguments) the list of possible energy values for which the transmission coefficient is to be obtained.
