This is a short documentation for fractdim.py code. 

This code can be used to determine the Minkowskiâ€“Bouligand dimension of any fractal that is given in a .pbm file.
The code uses a simple box covering method to determine the fractal dimension. 

The main function of the code is fract_dim that gets the name of the .pbm file containing the fractal and gives back the dimension of the fractal.
The other important function is the single_boxing function, which calculates the number of boxes needed to cover the whole fractal with a box_length given as 
an argument of the function. 


Short tutorial to use the code:

import fractdim as fd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

#to get the fractal dimension of the bransley fern
dim,blengths,bnums = fd.fract_dim(filename = "fractalFern_1600", f = 1, l = -1)


For further information see the docstrings and the documented code.

By using fractdim.py I was not able to precisely obtain the fractal dimension of the Bransley Fern. 
For that I obtained 1.78 for the dimension instead of 1.45.
For the Sierpinski fractal I obtained a pretty good etimate of the fractal dimension. 
for the Sierpinski fractal I obtained 1.56 while the analytical value is 1.58.
